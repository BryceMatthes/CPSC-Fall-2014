This program is the simpsons game, started off Tam's source.

Starts by displaying introText() to explain the game
Loads the game board fromt the file specified
Homer can move in 4 directions or stand in place
EPA agents can move in 8 directions or stand in place

Game should meet everything in the spec, Debugging is a little less thorough than other code I have retained

uses: Enhanced version: Homer has to spend a total of 10 successive turns in Alaska before he freezes. 
If he leaves and re-enters Alaska then the count down will start again at the beginning (he has 10 turns before he freezes).
